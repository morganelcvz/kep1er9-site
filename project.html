        Girls Planet 999 was a survival show that broadcasted on Mnet. The show's first episode broadcasted on Friday,
        August 6, 2021 at 8:20 PM (KST) and ran every Friday with 12 episodes in total. The final episode aired on
        October 22, 2021 where the final top 9 contestants were announced.
        <br />
        Girls Planet 999 was based on the themes and aesthetics of space where each of the three groups (Korea, China,
        Japan) represent a 'Planet'. In addition to the three 'Planets', there was a 'Master Council' made up of the two
        'K-pop Masters' whose roles were to mentor the 99 girls, four 'Vocal/Dance Masters' who trained the contestants'
        vocal, rap, and dance skills, and the 'Planet Master' who was the MC with the role of connecting the viewers
        with the show.
        <br />
        Outside of the 'Master Council' were the fans and audience, also known as the 'Planet Guardians', who had the
        role of determining the ranks of each contestant and ultimately the outcome of Girls Planet 999. The mobile app
        and web platform 'UNIVERSE' had the purpose of connecting the contestants and the 'Planet Guardians' through
        voting and other forms of media (such as video clips and photos featuring the contestants).
